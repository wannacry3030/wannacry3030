### Hey!

I'm someone who is passionate about ***KALI/ARCH-Linux*** and likes to **write code**.

<br>

I mostly write **SCSSjs** these days. See my _pinned repositories_ below.

Other than that, here are a few interesting **projects** (written in **Kutejs**, **SCSSjs**, **JS**) that are worth mentioning:

- [Hover-light-JS](https://github.com/wannacry3030/Hover-light-JS) - hover effect that spans to multiple card elements
- [html-css-designs](https://github.com/wannacry3030/html_css-designs) - a minimal sales site, using modern design elements
- [blog-HTML-e-CSS](https://github.com/wannacry3030/blog-HTML-e-CSS) - a blog-like site, using notions of flexbox and css-grid
- [neumorfismo-e-drop_shadow](https://github.com/wannacry3030/neumorfismo-e-drop_shadow) - A project made to display neumorfism and drop-shadow elements
- [pixel-site](https://github.com/wannacry3030/pixel_site) - a project made inspired by retrowave and retro-games
- [curvas](https://github.com/wannacry3030/curvas) - study of curves using CSS and KUTEjs
- [90-portfolio](https://github.com/wannacry3030/90-portfolio) - Portfolio made inspired on 90's sites, using nord color palette

Im working as a maintenance analyst for Grupo Horizonte, AMBEV logistical support, I also work with web-design, pen-testing and video editing (independently).

I'm currently updating my [Portfolio](https://fenrirdesign.tech) and studying ethical hacking related stuff. Feel free to reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/orhunp/) about **job-related** matters.
